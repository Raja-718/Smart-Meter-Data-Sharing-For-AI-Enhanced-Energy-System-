# Smart-Meter-Data-Sharing-For-AI-Enhanced-Energy-System-
As smart grids expand with rising electricity demand, securing fine-grained consumption data becomes critical. This Project presents a hybrid cryptographic architecture combining AES-256 for confidentiality, SHA-256 for integrity, and RSA-OAEP for secure key exchange. It enables fast, privacy-preserving search using hash-based queries and ensures tamper-proof logging via a lightweight hash-chain ledger. The system supports encrypted federated learning & analytics and cloud storage with audit-ready metadata. This end-to-end framework addresses key cyber risks—unauthorized access, leakage, and forgery—offering a scalable, standards-compliant solution for secure, intelligent energy networks.
